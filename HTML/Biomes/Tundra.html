      <h1> Tundra Biome </h1>
      <p>The Tundra (Arctic Tundra) Biome's temperatures are rising twice as fast as the rest of the world. The Tundra is expected to be warm enough to house vegetation and trees by 2050, the increasing tempratures will cause snow to melt, decreasing snow cover, rising sea levels, and a decrease in the sunlight that gets reflected back into the atmosphere. The warming has caused the Arctic to have late winters and earlier springs and it will increase the amount of greenery in the Arctic by 50 percent. The less snow there is to reflect the heat back into the atmosphere the warmer the Earth will get. Climate change could worsen already extreme weather events like hurricanes.</p>

      <h2 class = "animalTitle" > Polar Bear </h2>
      <br>
      <p>Polar Bears are endangered because of global warming which threatens their natural habitat by melting ice and snow in the Arctic; they are also threatened by pollution, poaching and unregulated hunting. You can help polar bears by living a more eco-friendly lifestyle, and recycling, which can help limit the fuel going into the air, reduce pollution, and clean up the garbage that is dumped in our ecosystem. You can also educate yourself and others about what is going on in the polar bear habitat, and you can adopt a polar bear, figuratively.</p>

      <h2 class = "animalTitle" >  Arctic Fox </h2>
      <p> The Arctic Fox isn't endangered worldwide, but they are endangered in the Tundra because they are hunted for their valuable fur. They also can't find enough food to eat as their prey is because the amount of the latter is alos decreasing from habitat loss.You can help by staying informed on what is happening to them and advocating by adopting an animal or educating others.</p>

      <h2 class = "animalTitle "> Walrus</h2>
      <p> Walruses are poached for their meat, tusks, and for the thrill of the hunters, though the biggest factor of why they are endangered is because of global warming. It causes a rise in sea levels, meaning they are losing stable sea ice and their habitat. Being aware of your carbon footprint, trying to decrease it, and living less on fuel are some of the ways to help the walrus population grow. </h2>
