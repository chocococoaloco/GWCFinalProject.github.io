      <h1> Taiga Biome </h1>
      <p>The Taiga Biome is the largest biome and has 50 million acres of land, but climate change is increasing the amount of forest fires in Siberia, which is leading a lot of plant and animals to endangerment and extinction. Warmer weather can increase lake levels and precipitation, it can also change vegetation patterns.</p>

      <h2 class = "animalTitle"> Siberian Tiger </h2>
      <br>
      <p>Siberian Tigers also known as Amur Tigers are losing their habitat, their source of food (like deer, rabbit, and fish) and they are getting poached for their meat, bones, whickers, and teeth. What you can do to help is to ask your member of congress to help protect siberian tigers from the illegal wildlife trade, also you can adopt a stuffed tiger to support the cause.</p>

      <h2 class = "animalTitle">  Amur Leopard </h2>
      <p> Amur Leopards are threatened and made endangered by illegal wild life trade, since they are poached for their spotted fur. Another threat for Amur leopards is prey scarcity, due to logging, the forest is going away, causing prey to be easily poached because of lack of cover leaving less food for the tigers. You can help by stopping wildlife crime and advocating for stricter poaching laws, also adopting a stuffed Amur leopard to support the cause.</p>

      <br>
      <h2 class = "animalTitle"> European Mink</h2>
      <p>
        European Mink's are also hunted for their fur which is often usd as a warm fabric for winter. River and lake pollution is another big reason the minks are endangered, this drives them out of their habitat because the water is no longer habitable or useful. The recent competition they are getting from the American Mink is also driving them to be extinct because American minks are getting all of their prey. Spreading the word on what's happening to minks, advocating against them being hunted, and donating are ways you can help.
