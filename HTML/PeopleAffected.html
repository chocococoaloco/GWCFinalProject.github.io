These extreme weather patterns are creating extended rainy seasons in some areas, and extended periods of drought in others, as well as introducing new climates to different regions. These extended seasons are creating climates that are able to sustain vectors for longer periods of time, allowing them to multiply rapidly, and also creating climates that are allowing the introduction and survival of new vectors."</h3>

Climate change can bring about disastrous weather events, of which 99 percent of total fatalities and 90 percent of all economic losses occur in less developed countries.
          Because of their already vulnerable state, poor communities are particularly at risk of feeling the effects of climate change."</h3>
